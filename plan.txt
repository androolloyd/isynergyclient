BEFORE RELEASE 0.8:
 * send periodic alive messages
  
BEFORE RELEASE 0.9:
 * make drag tableview not stall
 * implement periodic check for connection alive/re-connnect
 * nice idea: "compress" mouse movement if more data follows
   * could be done by MouseSupport/hid-support and/or BTstack Mouse

LATER:
 * implement Keyboard support
   * test if exists
   * inject data using hid-support
 * keycodes or chars?
